Yes, it's a clickbait title.   ;o)

But this is really how I failed at my first Challenge, while applying for a position at a big company.  
They ask to code a DNS proxy as a micro service, and expected me to code it, in Python, Go or whatever.  
Instead of coding it by myself, I used the simplest tool available in all Linux systems.  
The position was for SRE, so I didn't expect to code an application or service, but to code infrastructure deployments or operations.  
Let's hope somebody will find some value in this solution.  


## Task

Create a simple DNS to DNS-over-TLS proxy. It listens in TCP port 53 and talks to remote port TCP 853.

[Cloudflare docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/dns-over-tls) says you can test it with:

    Cloudflare supports DNS over TLS on 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1 on port 853.

    kdig -d @1.1.1.1 +tls-ca +tls-host=cloudflare-dns.com  example.com


## Exploration

First thing that comes to my mind is `nc` it's the tool to make pipes between sockets.  
Google says there is a tool like it that supports TLS, [socat](http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/doc/socat.html).  

``` bash
apt-cache search socat
sudo apt-get install socat
``` 

Also, let's use [kdig](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man1/kdig.1.html) to test it.


``` bash
apt-cache search kdig
sudo apt-get install knot-dnsutils
``` 

## Goal 1

The first goal is to use `socat` to turn:

`kdig @1.1.1.1    +tcp +tls-ca  -p 853    example.com`

into:

`kdig @127.0.0.1  +tcp          -p 8853   example.com`


Ok, done:

``` bash
socat TCP4-LISTEN:8853 SSL:1.1.1.1:853,commonname=cloudflare-dns.com
``` 

That probably will work inside a container, no need to `systemd` or other wrappings to keep it running:

``` bash
while true ; do socat TCP4-LISTEN:8853 SSL:1.1.1.1:853,commonname=cloudflare-dns.com ; done
``` 

## Goal 2

Make a `Dockerfile` for that.  

Looks like the Ubuntu Docker image does not have the usual CA certificates, so we'll have to install it.

Dockerfile:

```
FROM ubuntu:20.04
RUN apt-get update ; DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get -yq install socat ca-certificates
CMD bash -c 'while true ; do socat TCP4-LISTEN:53 SSL:1.1.1.1:853,commonname=cloudflare-dns.com ; done'
EXPOSE 53
``` 

Build it:

``` bash
docker build -t dnspipe .
```

Run it:

``` bash
docker run \
  --name=dnspipe01 \
  -p 8853:53 \
  -ti \
  dnspipe
``` 

Test it:

``` bash
kdig @127.0.0.1  +tcp          -p 8853   example.com
``` 

Destroy it:

``` bash
docker rm -f dnspipe01
```
