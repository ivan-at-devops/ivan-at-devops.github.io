title: "AWS CodeStar"
---

This is another failed Challenge because I did it too fast to be good.

## Goal

Create a new microservice that given a GET request to the `/helloworld` endpoint, it returns a JSON response `{ "hello": "world" }`. 
Special points how you manage TLS certificate generation.   


## Way

TLDR; See result in https://hello.ivan-at-devops.com/helloworld

I decided to use a serverless tech, AWS Lambda. Also, to use AWS CodeStar, to speed up all development.

After receiving the goal, in a couple of hours i've created:

- Open a new AWS account. You need an email and a phone number.
  - In My Account, activate `IAM User and Role Access to Billing Information`
  - In IAM, create Admin group, and `admin` user and give it `AdministratorAccess` rights. Download the CLI access keys.
  - Enable MFA authentication for root account. Synchronize the Authy app in your phone to it.
  - Log out and enter now using `admin` user.

- Choose a region to do your tests, for instance Stockholm. Go to AWS CodeStar.
  - Click Create service role warning.
  - Start a new Project. Choose type Python + AWS Lambda.
  - The system will use internal AWS CloudFormation to create a bunch of things:
    - AWS CodeCommit repo, with example code
    - AWS CodePipeline pipeline, that will automatically build and deploy code on each push
    - AWS Lambda, the result of the build
    - API Gateway, that will receive public HTTP requests and send them to the Lambda
    - additional IAM permissions for all that to work

- Now you can work locally, using [VSCode](https://aws.amazon.com/visualstudiocode/) (recommended) or any other IDE
  - Upload your SSH keys to `admin` user IAM Security Credentials, to access AWS CodeCommit repos
  - Configure your `~/.ssh/config` like this:
    ```
    Host git-codecommit.*.amazonaws.com
        IdentityFile              ~/.ssh/ivan-at-devops-2020
        User                      APKA***S36B
        PreferredAuthentications  publickey
    ``` 
      Beware the user key is not the same that the CLI key, despite having the same format.

- Or you can let AWS provide an online IDE for you. Click `Set up AWS Cloud9`
  - Automatically it will create an EC2 instance, with a development environment, and the example code clone, and provide a web interface into it.

- Make your changes in the code, commit, push. Watch the AWS Pipeline do the magic.

- Visit some URL like `https://1gu4wfuoz6.execute-api.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/` to see the result.

- Let's practice with HTTPS certs. The API Gateway can do the job.
  - In Route53, request a new domain, for instance `ivan-at-devops.com`. Wait for it, about half an hour. Put some dummy A record for the root in the zone, because all zones need the root to be type A.
  - In Certificate manager, request a new certificate for `*.ivan-at-devops.com` and `ivan-at-devops.com`. Select DNS as validation method. These certificates will autorenew forever. All can be done with a few clicks.
  - In Route53, create a new record for `hello.ivan-at-devops.com` of type Alias to the API Gateway.
  - Now in API Gateway you can set a Custom domain name, like `hello.ivan-at-devops.com` to your existing API Gateway.
  - Also you can use an API Mapping to link `/helloworld` to your AWS Lambda.
